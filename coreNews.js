	text: "<p>The city of Pileus -- your home -- is afire with incredible news: the City Council has declared itself independent of and no longer subject to the rule of the Ogre King.</p><p>For many, the move is a long time coming.  The king's endless wars have dragged the kingdom through conflict after conflict, conscripting soldiers to fight far from home and taxing whoever is left behind to keep the war machine running.  The king's subjects have long bemoaned the luck that gave them such a thin-skinned, reckless tyrant for a ruler.  Would-be revolutionaries have decried his rule from every street corner, it seems, spouting a never-ending series of plots to sponsor some relation of the King, near or distant, in an insurrection to seize the throne.  No such scheme has ever come to fruition.</p><p>But now, in the aftermath of the Skogland-Verdanta War, the city elders see an opportunity to get out.  The king's armies are tapped and demoralized.  His coffers are empty.  His allies are few, and tired of fighting for him.  Now, the guildmasters of the Council insist, is the moment to throw off the yoke of his tyranny.</p><p>Perhaps more surprising than the break itself is that the Council has not petitioned someone of royal blood to take a throne here.  Instead, they have declared that the city can <em>govern itself,</em> through the will and judgment of the people.  The city of Pileus will stand, independent of any crown, or fall back into oppression, by the strength of its citizenry.</p><p>The Council has put out a call for all able-bodied citizens to stand up and be counted as patriots.  The Ogre King may be weakened, but he is not powerless, and he will come to reconquer the city.  The City Council intends to be ready when he comes.  The Council is issuing charters for self-organized companies of fighters and auxiliaries.  These companies will be employed at various tasks such as securing the surrounding countryside and uprooting loyalist strongholds.</p><p>This, it seems, is your chance.  A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take a role on the stage of history, to make a name for yourself, and to defend the beautiful cosmopolitain city you call home.</p><p><em>Click on the <strong>Adventures</strong> tab above and select the adventure <strong>The City Revolts</strong> to take your place in history!</em></p>",
